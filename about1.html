            <p id="pg">
                Our Noise Pollution Monitoring Device is an embedded system that collects data using its onboard microphone.
                It gathers noise data in decibel form and is used to plot graphs and solve the ongoing problem of noise pollution.

        <div class="important">
        <h3 id="heading1">Why is it important?</h3>
        <p id="pg">This is important because it provides valuable information on areas that may exceed noise pollution.
            It is also especially important in planning for building residential sectors and monitoring noise pollution can be a major factor in whether the construction can go ahead.
            Things like hotel and housing estates all benefit from the surrounding area being quiet. </p>

            <h3 id="heading1">Other Potential Uses?</h3>
            <p id="pg">This device can be used in other areas such as school environments,
                 It can benefit children suffering from ASD that are sensitive to noise.
                 This device has the potential to calculate when the optimal period for commuting to class is,
                 such that the noise of the school is at its lowest. </p>
